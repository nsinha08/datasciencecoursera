Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, 
work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data 
that can be used for later analysis. 

Version 1.0
==================================================================
Dataset: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set [1]
==================================================================

The course project submission includes the following files:
==================================================================

- 'README.md'      : It contatins the details of the analysis 
                     files.

- 'CodeBook.md'    : It contains all the relevant information 
                     pertaining to the variables, the data, 
                     and any transformations or work performed 
                     to clean up the data.

- 'run_analysis.R' : R script that does the following:
  
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard 
     deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
     data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy 
     data set with the average of each variable for each activity and 
     each subject.

  Finally, it exports a final tidy data set file "TidyData.txt", 
  to be submitted as part of this course project.

- 'TidyData.txt'   : The final tidy data set.
